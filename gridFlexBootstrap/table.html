            the International Association of Electrical Engineers. Learning that
            his mother was close to death, he arrived in Gospic on April 15,

            American architect Stanford White. It was completed in 1902,
            although the tower, as originally envisaged, was never finished.
            According to Tesla’s plan, signals from the transmission tower would
            be sent wirelessly through the Earth, which is a conducting body,
            and received anywhere on Earth.

            He had applied for this patent, no. 787,412, five years earlier, on

            which he found to have wavelengths of from 25 to 70 kilometers. From
            his own research he concluded that waves of this kind could
            propagate through the earth in all directions. Tesla’s intention was
            to confirm the idea of the resonance of the planet. He expected that
            these resonances would be 6, 18 and 30 Hz.
