          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p class="m-auto">
            Born (10.07.1856) and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied
            engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree,
            gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony
            and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In
            1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a
            naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison
            Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With
            the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up
            laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of
            electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC)
            induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
            Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of
            money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that
            company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop inventions he
            could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
            mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and
            early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one
            of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor
            and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons
            at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.
            Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting
            and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his
            high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and
            Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility
            of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these
            ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project,
            an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter,
            but ran out of funding before he could complete it. After
            Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the
            1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most
            of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving
            behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[10]
            Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until
            1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the
            SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has
            been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.
